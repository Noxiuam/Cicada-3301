# Cicada-3301
A public repository of my personal efforts for solving Cicada 3301.

## What this repository contains

### [DeepWebHash]("https://github.com/Noxiuam/Cicada-3301/tree/main/DeepWebHash")
- This project module is highly incomplete, README will be updated once it is actually in a production state.

### [Translator](https://github.com/Noxiuam/Cicada-3301/tree/main/Translator)
- A simple translator for the runes from the Liber Primus, this does not use the ones from the table given to solvers in 2013, rather a program from one of the Wiki pages I found.
